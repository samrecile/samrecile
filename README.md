I’m Sam Recile, and I’m an aspiring software developer with experience using Python's Data Science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, etc.) to perform data analysis and develop machine learning models. I'm also comfortable building and deploying full-stack web applications with Django and ReactJs.
