Hi! I’m Sam, and I’m an aspiring software developer with experience using Python's Data Science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, etc.) to perform data analysis and develop machine learning models. I also have experience building and deploying full-stack web applications with Django and ReactJs.
