Hi! Iâ€™m Sam, and I use Python's Django framework to build full-stack web applications. I also use the Django Rest Framework and Python's Data Science libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, etc.) to develop machine learning models and build APIs. On top of that I have a working understanding of ReactJs and how to build applications with a React frontend and Django backend.
